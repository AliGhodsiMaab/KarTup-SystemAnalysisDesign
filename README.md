# KarTup-SystemAnalysisDesign
# Systems Analysis and Design Course Project

Overview
This repository contains the complete documentation for our group project in the Systems Analysis and Design course. The system we analyzed and designed is called KarTup, a job-matching platform that helps job seekers find jobs and employers find suitable candidates.

The name "KarTup" comes from Turkish:
Kar means job
Tup is a verb meaning to find
Together, KarTup represents "Finding Jobs".

This project was developed collaboratively by a team of 7 students and includes a full documentation of all analysis and design phases of the system.

KarTup is designed as an online platform that bridges the gap between employers and job seekers.
Key features include:
Creating job ads and applications
Searching for suitable jobs or candidates
Managing profiles and communication between users

This project covers all steps of structured analysis and design, including:
Requirement gathering
Use case modeling
Sequence and class diagrams
Database design
UI sketches
