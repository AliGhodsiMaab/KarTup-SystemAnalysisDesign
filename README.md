# KarTup-SystemAnalysisDesign  
### *Systems Analysis and Design Course Project*

## Overview  
This repository contains the complete documentation for our group project in the **Systems Analysis and Design** course.

The system we analyzed and designed is called **KarTup**, a job-matching platform that helps:  
-  **Job seekers** find appropriate job opportunities  
-  **Employers** find suitable candidates for their job ads  

> The name **"KarTup"** comes from Turkish:  
> - **Kar** = *Job*  
> - **Tup** = *To find*  
> Together, **KarTup** means *“Finding Jobs”*

This project was collaboratively developed by a **team of 7 students** and includes full documentation of all analysis and design phases.
